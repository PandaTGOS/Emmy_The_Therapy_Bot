# Emmy_The_Therapy_Bot
Worked on a project on face recognition/detection, using the DeepFace python library ;
And connecting it with an AI model trained to provide therapeutic advice which relies on the face recog. to determine the emotion of the user in a timely manner, and providing the user responses based on their emotion.
The above system connected to a speech-to-text and text-to-speech module, turns the above system into a therapy bot that will listen to your voice and speak out the feedback.
